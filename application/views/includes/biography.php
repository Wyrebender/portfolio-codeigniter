<p>First of all&#44; I would like to take a moment to say thank you for spending some time viewing my portfolio website.  Hopefully&#44; my <a href="<?php echo base_url()?>index.php/portfolio">work showcase</a> would help you to become more interested into working together as a team.</p>
<br />

<p>I was born in <a href="http://www.danville-va.gov/" target="_blank">Danville&#44; Virginia</a>&#44; which is located one mile from the North Carolina border.   Throughout the years in elementary school&#44; I have a passion in creating fine artwork.  Any creative skills I involved from art&#44; I have done it&#58; self-portrait drawing&#44; woodcarving&#44; pottery&#44; basket weaving&#44; and paper mache.</p> 
<br />

<p>But once I graduated in high school during the mid 1990s&#44; I would have never thought that my artistic skills would have landed me into a desirable profession.  One of the careers I have found that required all the skills I have developed throughout the years was in dental laboratory technology.  So in 1997&#44; I graduated at <a href="http://www.reynolds.edu/" target="_blank">J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College</a> in Richmond&#44; Virginia with a degree in Associate of Applied Science and a Dental Laboratory Technology career certificate.  From there&#44; I decided to become an orthodontic laboratory technician and spent six years designing framework retainers and creating art in plastic appliances.</p>
<br />

<p> Throughout the years in working in a few dental laboratories&#44; its industry began to decline due to lack of dentists&#39; demand in laboratory services.  In 2003&#44; I moved back to my hometown&#44; Danville&#44; Virginia&#44; and attended <a href="http://www.dcc.vccs.edu/" target="_blank">Danville Community College</a> in search for a new career while I was working at a grocery store for five years. </p>
<br />

<p>Besides fine art&#44; my other passion is in computer technology.  During the years of attending Danville Community College&#44; I took various computer and information technology classes. I was later introduced to a web design curriculum and realized that building user interface layouts require something I am definitely capable to adapt&#58; graphic design skills. </p>
<br />

<p>I was so intrigued in learning web design&#59; I decided to further my skills by moving south and attending <a href="http://www.fullsail.edu/" target="_blank">Full Sail University</a>. in <a href="http://www.cityofwinterpark.org/" target="_blank">Winter Park&#44; Florida</a>.  So &#39;here I am&#39;.  I am now a graduate at Full Sail University&#44; following my passion and living my dream.</p>
<br />

<p>Oh by the way&#44; I love to listen to all types of music; especially smooth jazz&#44; electronica and 80s music.  One of my favorite artists is Paul Hardcastle &#40;smooth jazz genre&#41;.  In my downtime&#44; I enjoy road trips&#44; cycling and other outdoor activities.
